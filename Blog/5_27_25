My girlfriend is very fond of the types of cheap IOT lights you can buy at hardware stores. They are energy efficient and can be changed to a variety of colors, but I find the Android app to be lacking. Specifically, the app does not seem to handle the fact that the lights have don't connect well to the Wifi and therefor miss a lot of the commands.

To remediate these inequicies, I'm going to code a suite of tools that will allow us to automate these lights better. Previously I found a few scant peices of information on how to turn the lights on and off using curl commands, or query them for their current states for a JSON response. I'm going to build upon this information and create some tools that do the job better than the app the lights ship with.

The first part of the project will be coming up with a system that queries the current state of the lights and stores this data.
